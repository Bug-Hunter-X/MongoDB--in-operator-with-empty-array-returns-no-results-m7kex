# MongoDB $in operator with empty array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue is that a query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` returns an empty array, rather than all documents, as one might expect. This can cause unexpected behavior in applications.

The solution provided addresses this issue by providing alternative ways to achieve the desired outcome.
